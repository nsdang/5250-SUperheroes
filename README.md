### Overview
They are called the SUperheroes but are they really? Once, SUperheroes used to be deserving of the title. However, age has made them deluded, jaded, and arrogant. They see themselves as above the common people they swore to protect. Now, the people must revolt against them.

In the game SUper Heroes, players are to assemble a team using the characters available to them to fight against waves of enemies. Allied teams will consist of various Seattle U facilities as characters, and enemy teams will contain different archetypes of corrupted civilians.
